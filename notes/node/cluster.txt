to speed-up your node app use cluster.

Node.js provides for scaling up the applications is to split a single process into multiple 
processes or workers, in Node.js terminology. This can be achieved through a cluster module.


The cluster module allows you to create child processes (workers), which share all the server
ports with the main Node process (master).


cluster module contain two main method - online and exit.


online is emitted when the worker is forked and sends the online message. exit is emitted 
when a worker process dies. Later, weâ€™ll see how we can use these two events to control
the lifetime of the workers.


The os module contains a cpus() function, which returns an array of CPU cores
os.cups().length
