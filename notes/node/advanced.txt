> what is lexical scoping
    >  Lexical scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables 
        and other resources of their parent scope. This means that the child functions are lexically bound to the 
        execution context of their parents. Lexical scope is sometimes also referred to as static scope.
